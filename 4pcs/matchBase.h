// This file is part of the implementation of the 4-points Congruent Sets (4PCS)
// algorithm presented in:
//
// 4-points Congruent Sets for Robust Surface Registration
// Dror Aiger, Niloy J. Mitra, Daniel Cohen-Or
// ACM SIGGRAPH 2008 and ACM Transaction of Graphics.
//
// Given two sets of points in 3-space, P and Q, the algorithm applies RANSAC
// in roughly O(n^2) time instead of O(n^3) for standard RANSAC, using an
// efficient method based on invariants, to find the set of all 4-points in Q
// that can be matched by rigid transformation to a given set of 4-points in P
// called a base. This avoids the need to examine all sets of 3-points in Q
// against any base of 3-points in P as in standard RANSAC.
// The algorithm can use colors and normals to speed-up the matching
// and to improve the quality. It can be easily extended to affine/similarity
// transformation but then the speed-up is smaller because of the large number
// of congruent sets. The algorithm can also limit the range of transformations
// when the application knows something on the initial pose but this is not
// necessary in general (though can speed the runtime significantly).

// demo): http://graphics.stanford.edu/~niloy/research/fpcs/fpcs_sig_08.html

// and applications.
